# Here is a document containing the information needed to create a partner profile for the Atlassian Marketplace. It includes technical requirements about the logo and banner, as well as the content requirements for the partner description and name.

Create a partner profile
Your partner profile establishes credibility when users are browsing your app(s), so be sure to put some thought and effort into your name and logo. We strongly recommend outsourcing your logo to a graphic designer. There are resources that can help you find one easily and cheaply, such as 99designs or Fiverr.

partner profile

Asset	Dimensions	Description
Partner name

Up to 40 characters

Displayed with your apps, homepage sidebars, and on your partner page. Use your company name or, if an individual, your own name. Be mindful of trademark and copyright guidelines. Short names are preferred.

Partner description	
Up to 750 characters

Describe your what organization does/what problem(s) it intends to solve.

Partner logo

144 x 144px PNG/JPG/GIF

Upload a large, clear, front-facing image that fits into a square. Your logo should be relevant to your partner name, as it will appear on your partner page next to your name. Make sure it has a transparent background.

Contact details	
N/A

Add as much contact information as you can, especially a link to your own website, if you have one.

Support details	
N/A

How and when can your users contact you if they need support? Even better is providing an external link to support documentation. If you sell paid via Atlassian apps, you must provide support contact details.

Create a listing for your app
The Marketplace requires branding materials to list your app on the site, whether your app is free or paid. In usability testing, customers express preferences for multiple small screenshots, shorter text elements, and easy-to-digest highlights. For this reason, we require three highlights for every app in the Marketplace. This also provides a uniform visual experience from app to app and lets Marketplace visitors quickly learn what three things your app can do for them.

If you're struggling to come up with three distinct highlights for your app, we suggest framing your app in different contexts. For example, how does your app make working in an Atlassian product easier? What are the broad goals people can meet using your app? Does it save time? Does it improve admin tasks? 

Conversely, if you are unsure how to trim your app benefits down to only three, consider a similar approach. Instead of listing all the things your app can do, list the most salient benefits. We suggest choosing three distinct high-level benefits. 

In the hero version of the listing, you have the option to include a video. We suggest including a video walk through of your app if possible.
