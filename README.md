# Atlassian Marketplace Listing Requirements

## Create a partner profile
Your partner profile establishes credibility when users are browsing your app(s), so be sure to put some thought and effort into your name and logo. We strongly recommend outsourcing your logo to a graphic designer. There are resources that can help you find one easily and cheaply, such as 99designs or Fiverr.

### Partner Profile Requirements

| Asset | Dimensions | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Partner name | Up to 40 characters | Displayed with your apps, homepage sidebars, and on your partner page. Use your company name or, if an individual, your own name. Be mindful of trademark and copyright guidelines. Short names are preferred. |
| Partner description | Up to 750 characters | Describe your what organization does/what problem(s) it intends to solve. |
| Partner logo | 144 x 144px PNG/JPG/GIF | Upload a large, clear, front-facing image that fits into a square. Your logo should be relevant to your partner name, as it will appear on your partner page next to your name. Make sure it has a transparent background. |
| Contact details | N/A | Add as much contact information as you can, especially a link to your own website, if you have one. |
| Support details | N/A | How and when can your users contact you if they need support? Even better is providing an external link to support documentation. If you sell paid via Atlassian apps, you must provide support contact details. |

## Create a listing for your app
The Marketplace requires branding materials to list your app on the site, whether your app is free or paid. In usability testing, customers express preferences for multiple small screenshots, shorter text elements, and easy-to-digest highlights. For this reason, we require three highlights for every app in the Marketplace.

### App Listing Requirements

| Asset | Dimensions | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| App name | 60 characters or less | Use title casing (for example, Project Planner, not Project planner). Using the Atlassian product name is acceptable (App Name for Product Name), but not starting with the product name. |
| App tagline | 130 characters or less | Provide a short phrase that summarizes what your app can do. |
| App summary (Legacy) | 250 characters or less | Provide a plain text app summary. Marketplace displays your app summary in search results. |
| More details | 1000 characters or less | List awards, testimonials, accolades, language support, or other details about your app. |
| Video | No limit | Provide a YouTube link to a short video about your app. |
| App logo | 144 x 144px PNG/JPG | Upload a crisp logo. Use transparent or bounded, chiclet-style backgrounds. |
| App banner | 1120 x 548px PNG/JPG (high-res) or 560 x 274px PNG/JPG (standard) | Include your app name, your partner name, and brief text about your app's functionality. |
| Highlight title (3) | 50 characters or less | Add a short action-oriented title for your highlight. |
| Highlight summary (3) | 220 characters or less | Summarize your app's key features. |
| Highlight screenshot (3) | 1840 x 900px PNG/JPG (high-res) or 920 x 450px PNG/JPG (standard) | Illustrate your highlight with a screenshot. |
| Highlight screenshot - cropped (3) | 580 x 330px PNG/JPG | Provide a cropped version of your screenshot. |
